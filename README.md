# rollercoaster-simulation
A rollercoaster simulation game created using Unity as part of my attempt to dive in the world of computer graphics. The scripts were made in C# and the assets used were downloaded online. The simulation has camera controls – ability to view in 1st and 3rd person Point-of-View, pan camera – and movement controls – ability for car to stop.
